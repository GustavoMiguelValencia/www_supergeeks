  <h1> Process </h1>
<p> Our process for making GeekSurvey into a reality. </p>
<hr>
<h2> Project Description </h2>
<p> As it currently stands, researchers have a difficult time connecting with willing and qualified participants for software engineering research opportunities.
    Software engineering researchers have tried both social media apps and emails to recruit potential research participants, but to little success.
    Currently, a response rate of 5-10% is deemed acceptable. The team here at SuperGeeks believes that we can do better. We aim to develop a secure, web-based platform
    that will effectively and efficiently manage software engineering research recruiting efforts. Our platform aims to produce valid, reliable, and relevant data for our
    clients and other software engineering researchers. The initial concept for this project was provided by our sponsor, in the form of a 
    <a href="docs/Gerosa-GeekSurvey"> Capstone project proposal</a>. </p>
<hr>
<h2> Current Progress </h2>
<p> We are currently beginning work on our Technological Feasibility Analysis. Our scholar will be reviewing the assignment specifications by our next team meeting (10/11/21).
    At this meeting, we plan on reviewing and delegating parts of the document to each team member, with the ultimate goal of combining our findings into a single document.
    We will then refine our combined document, both as a team and with guidance from our mentor. 
</p>
<hr>
<h2> Schedule, Resources, and Budget </h2>
<p> Our schedule showing the work we have completed and are currently working on can be seen in the table below. The current week's worth of work is bolded for your convenience.
    Given that we are still in early stages of development, we do not currently have any resources to link to nor a concrete budget as we are still researching potential solutions.
